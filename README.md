💯 100 Days of LeetCode


📌 Introduction


This repository is a personal journey through 100 days of solving LeetCode problems, aimed at building consistent coding habits and strengthening core programming concepts. Each day features a well-documented solution to a selected problem, ranging from easy to hard, covering topics commonly asked in technical interviews. The focus is on writing clean, understandable code that not only solves the problem but also explains the logic behind it.



🚀 Features




Daily Progress: A structured log of 100 days, each with a dedicated problem and solution.




Topic-Wise Coverage: Includes problems on arrays, strings, linked lists, binary trees, recursion, backtracking, dynamic programming, graphs, and more.




Beginner-Friendly Code: Every solution is accompanied by step-by-step comments for better understanding.




Multi-Language Solutions: Primarily written in Java, with selected problems also available in Python.




LeetCode Links: Each day links directly to the original problem statement on LeetCode for easy reference.





🎯 Purpose


The goal of this repository is to:




Encourage consistent daily problem-solving.




Help learners at all levels improve their algorithmic thinking.




Provide clean and efficient solutions that can be used for interview preparation.




Serve as a coding diary and resource for others looking to begin or continue their LeetCode journey.



Each day has its own folder containing the solution file and a brief explanation if needed.
